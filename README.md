> _Experience the next generation of esports management with 3D Map Vetoes, Live Brackets, and Real-time Discord Updates._

V-RIVALS is optimized for Vercel. Since the **Discord Bot** runs via **Serverless Actions** (spinning up per-request), you do **not** need a separate worker process for the bot. It works out of the box!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites Required!**
> The button below handles code deployment and configuration, but it **cannot create your database**.
> You MUST have your own **Appwrite Instance** (Cloud or Self-Hosted) and **Discord Application** created beforehand to populate the environment variables during setup.
